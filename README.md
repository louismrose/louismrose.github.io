# louismrose.com

This repo configures my website at louismrose.com. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, and written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) / [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

## Development

* Install dependencies with: `sudo gem install bundler jekyll jekyll-paginate`
* Serve locally with `jekyll serve`
* Deploy by pushing to `origin/master`

## Troubleshooting

If a post doesn't publish when deploying, check the following:

* Is the post in the `_posts` directory? Does it have the `md` file extension?
* Does the post appear locally when running `jekyll serve`?
* Are there any errors under the `GitHub Pages` settings for the GitHub repository?
